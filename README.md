Suppose that the diﬀerent policyholders of a casualty insurance company generate claims according to a Poisson process with a common rate λ, and that each claim amount has distribution F. Suppose also that new customers sign up according to a Poisson process with rate ν, and that each existing policyholder remains with the company for an exponentially distributed time with rate µ. Finally, suppose that each policyholder pays the insurance ﬁrm at a ﬁxed rate per unit time. Starting with n0 customers and initial capital a0 ≥ 0, use simulation to estimate the probability that the ﬁrm’s capital is always nonnegative at all times up to time T.
